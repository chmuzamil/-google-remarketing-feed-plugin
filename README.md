### Products CSV Header

The CSV file generated by this plugin includes a header row that defines the columns and their order. Each column corresponds to a specific piece of information about the products in the feed. The CSV header is defined in the plugin code to ensure consistency and clarity in the structure of the generated CSV file.

### CSV Header Columns:

The current CSV header includes the following columns:

1. **ID:** Product ID in the WordPress database.
2. **Item title:** Product title or name.
3. **Item description:** Product description.
4. **Final URL:** Product URL or link.
5. **Image URL:** URL of the product's featured image.
6. **Price:** Product regular price.
7. **Sale price:** Product sale price (if applicable).
8. **Item category:** Product category.
9. **Status:** Product availability status (e.g., In stock, Out of stock).

### Customizing CSV Header:

If you wish to customize the CSV header, you can modify the `csv_header` on line 151 constant in the plugin code. 
This constant defines an array of column names that make up the CSV header. 
Feel free to add, remove, or reorder columns based on your specific requirements.

For example, to include additional information such as brand and weight, you can modify the constant as follows:

```php
// Constants for CSV Headers
$csv_header = array(
    'ID',
    'Item title',
    'Item description',
    'Final URL',
    'Image URL',
    'Price',
    'Sale price',
    'Item category',
    'Status',
    'Brand',        // Additional column: Product brand
    'Weight',       // Additional column: Product weight
));
```
